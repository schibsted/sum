## Getting Started

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You then need to configure the environment variables. See the section below for more information.

After configuring environment variables, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # Get this from OpenAI
OPENAI_GPT_MODEL="" # This is the model you want to use. (If not specified, it will use the gpt-3.5-turbo model)
```
